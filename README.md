## Project Overview

The **COVID-19 Global Data Tracker** is a comprehensive, data-driven Jupyter Notebook project that leverages authoritative datasets to analyze and visualize the global progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. By harnessing cleaned data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), this project delivers a deep dive into pandemic metrics such as confirmed cases, fatalities, vaccination rates, and recovery trends â€” tracked over time and across multiple countries.

Through rigorous data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced visualizations, this project provides a narrative-rich analytical report designed for researchers, data enthusiasts, and decision-makers seeking actionable insights from COVID-19 data.
